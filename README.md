# Ember-cli-localstorage-adapter

This plugin is pretty much a port from [https://github.com/locks/ember-localstorage-adapter](https://github.com/locks/ember-localstorage-adapter). I just modified it to work with ember 2.x.

## Reason
I am always trying to prototype apps or concepts very quickly without the need for a server or an API.  I just work on the UI concepts to flush them out.  This lets me iterate very quickly on the frontend without having to worry about the backend but it also persists the data, so I am not contstantly repopulating data while developing.

Theoritically, you should be able to swap out the adapter with a real api adapter without having to change anything.

## Installation

* `ember install ember-cli-localstorage-adapter`

## Usage
Use ember data as you usually do.  No need to configure or do anything.
